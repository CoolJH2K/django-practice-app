# django-practice-app
## Description
In which I carefully followed a tutorial for writing my first Django app through a [series of documents](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/) on the official Django website.
### Why did I make this?
I already practiced using Python for web development by [making an app using Flask](https://github.com/CoolJH2K/python-newsfeed), so I decided, "Why not also follow a tutorial for making an app using Django, too?" I thought it would expand my expertise in web development.
