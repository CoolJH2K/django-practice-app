# django-practice-app
## Description
In which I carefully followed a tutorial for writing my first Django app through a [series of documents](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/) on the official Django website.
### Why did I make this?
I already practiced using Python for web development by [making an app using Flask](https://github.com/CoolJH2K/python-newsfeed), so I decided, "Why not also follow a tutorial for making an app using Django, too?" I thought it would expand my expertise in web development.
### What did I learn?
I learned how to create different templates and files for a Django app. After that, I learned how to apply those templates and files to my app and how they each function. I also learned how to configure things with a URLconf module.
## Installation
N/A
## Usage
I'm just using this to show everyone a tutorial I followed for making a Django app.
## Credits
I would like to thank the Django team for offering me a comprehensive tutorial on the Django website. The instructions were very easy to understand, and I honestly feel like I've expanded my knowledge of web development working on this!
